# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a proof of concept for integrating TMDB (The Movie Database) API to provide trending and search capabilities as an alternative to the existing Trakt API implementation. The implementation will follow the established patterns in the codebase for API integration, including fetch wrappers, types, query options, and hooks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create TMDB API integration following the existing codebase patterns, so that I can maintain consistency and reusability across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing TMDB integration THEN the system SHALL follow the existing pattern of fetchWrapper → types → endpoints → queryOptions → hooks
2. WHEN creating API functions THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces that match TMDB API response structures
3. WHEN implementing fetch operations THEN the system SHALL use a centralized fetch wrapper similar to the Trakt implementation
4. WHEN creating query options THEN the system SHALL use TanStack Query patterns consistent with existing Trakt implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view trending movies and TV shows from TMDB, so that I can discover popular content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing trending content THEN the system SHALL fetch trending movies from TMDB API
2. WHEN accessing trending content THEN the system SHALL fetch trending TV shows from TMDB API
3. WHEN displaying trending content THEN the system SHALL show movie/show title, year, rating, and overview
4. WHEN trending data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN trending data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display error messages with retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for movies and TV shows using TMDB, so that I can find specific content I'm interested in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering a search query THEN the system SHALL search both movies and TV shows simultaneously
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display results with title, year, type (movie/show), and overview
3. WHEN search query is empty THEN the system SHALL display trending content as fallback
4. WHEN search is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
5. WHEN search fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with TMDB content items, so that I can navigate to detailed views or perform actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tapping on a movie item THEN the system SHALL navigate to movie details screen
2. WHEN tapping on a TV show item THEN the system SHALL navigate to show details screen
3. WHEN displaying content items THEN the system SHALL show TMDB poster images when available
4. WHEN content items are pressed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TMDB components organized under screens/tmdb, so that the code is properly structured and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating TMDB components THEN the system SHALL place them under src/components/screens/tmdb directory
2. WHEN implementing TMDB API logic THEN the system SHALL place it under src/lib/tmdb directory
3. WHEN creating TMDB-specific types THEN the system SHALL organize them in appropriate type files
4. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL follow React Native Paper design patterns used elsewhere in the app
