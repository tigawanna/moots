# Appwrite Configuration
# Replace these with your actual Appwrite project settings

# Your Appwrite project ID
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Your Appwrite endpoint URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1

# For self-hosted Appwrite, use your own endpoint:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-domain.com/v1

# OAuth Redirect URLs (for Appwrite Console configuration)
# Development URLs:
# Success URL: exp://127.0.0.1:19000/--/auth/callback
# Failure URL: exp://127.0.0.1:19000/--/auth/error

# Production URLs (replace 'moots' with your app scheme):
# Success URL: moots://auth/callback
# Failure URL: moots://auth/error

# Note: These URLs should be configured in your Appwrite Console under 
# Auth > OAuth2 Providers > Google > Redirect URLs
# Make sure to add BOTH development and production URLs
